# fracpaqpy
Python version of FracPaQ - software for the quantification of fracture patterns

# Description 
fracpaqpy is a set of Python scripts.  Each script generates one plot - e.g., a map or a histogram - that quantifies one aspect of a 2D fracture pattern. Fracture pattern data are passed to the scripts via a simple ASCII tab-delimited text file of fracture traces nodes (x,y coordinates).
# Installation 
For now, installation is just a simple copy of all the files in the code folder to a folder on your machine.  In future, I'll make it a package installable through pip or conda.
# Usage 
fracpaqpy runs from the command line, i.e., a terminal session.  The interface has been designed to resemble that for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT).

# Contributing
For now, fracpaqpy is maintained by Dave Healy.  But soon, I'll open it up for general contributions. 

# Credits 
fracpaqpy is based on the MATLAB version of FracPaQ, written by Dave Healy, Roberto Rizzo, and others. 

# License 
fracpaqpy is open source, free software.
